### Scenario UC1

A council official, which we have classified within the *Healthy Citizen actor*, has been requested to analyse how the national lockdown impacted the emission of particles such as Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) around certain locations in Bristol during the month of March. To complete this task, the official will visit the *Historic Pollution Data* website where he will be able to select a table with the name of *See pollution records from March*. He will then narrow down his search by *selecting* his desired location e.g., Temple Way. This request will be read by the *Historic Pollution Data Server* which will send a query to the *Database* so that a result is provided to the original request made by the official. 

who does weekly activities outdoors is interested to understand what the pollution levels have been in his area over the past days, or weeks, by doing so he hopes that by analysing this data he can see patternhs, or spykes of pollution against certain times and areas, thus allowing him to choose a time and area that will provide greater benefit to his outdoor activities.

### Scenario UC2&3
A granpa is taking his grandsons out for a walk, but he knows it is peak hour so he wants to compare the areas with higher concentration of pollution, against areas with lower levels of pollution, this will enable him to avoid certain areas with higher levels of pollution.
