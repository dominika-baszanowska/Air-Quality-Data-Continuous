# Project Proposal

## Business Case

### Problem statement
Pollution is known to have a harmful effect on people who are exposed to it on a regular basis. In Bristol, due to the amount of traffic during peak hours, high levels of poluttion is concentrated in certain areas of the city. As consequence, people wanting to do activities outside might find themselves breathing **air of poor quality**, which **undermines** their initial goal of living a **healthy life** by exercising outdoors. If we can tell people who live local to Bristol which areas concentrate the highest amount of Carbon Dioxide at any given time, then it would allow them to plan their journey ahead, and minimise their exposure to this toxic air. 

### Business benefits
* Promote exercising outdoors.
* Help identify areas with higher pollution levels so that the Council takes action.
* People can minimise breathing air of poor quality by checking real-time statistics on pollution.
* Local shops located in areas with less pollution might see an increase in their sales, as a result of more people doing outdoors exercise in those areas.
* Life expectancy might increase as a result of people chosing the quality of the air they breath. 
* Diseases associated to pollution might decrease overtime.

### Options Considered
* Department for Environment Food & Rural Affairs - UK Air Information Resource.
* BBC Pollution Postcode Checker.
* Air Quality England.

### Expected Risks
* Users are already used to the available options, hence low engagement might occur. 
* Due to the pandemic, pollution levels might have decreased in general, hence there might be no need to identify which areas have the highest pollution levels, which was one of the benefits of this proposal.

## Project Scope
Below is a detailed list of every entity that applies to our project scope:

* **People exercising outdoors** - This audience is to be targeted as they prioritize areas with less pollution to do exercise and will be more likely to use our app than other audiences. 
* **Bristol**, As the dataset is relevant to Bristol, we are focusing our app in providing value to those living in Bristol only.
* Our app should work in mobile devices with **Android**, or **IOS** as well as on **websites**. 
* **HTML** will be used for the design process as inticated in the assignment specifications. 
* **Github** will provide us with the means to work collaboratively as well as a mean of having our documentation checked.
