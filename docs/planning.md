# Project Proposal

## Business Case

### Problem statement
Pollution is known to have a harmful effect on people who are exposed to it on a regular basis. In Bristol, due to the amount of traffic during peak hours, high levels of poluttion is concentrated in certain areas of the city. As consequence, people wanting to do activities outside might find themselves breathing **air of poor quality**, which **undermines** their initial goal of living a **healthy life** by exercising outdoors. If we can tell people who live local to Bristol which areas concentrate the highest amount of Carbon Dioxide at any given time, then it would allow them to plan their journey ahead, and minimise their exposure to this toxic air. 

### Business benefits
* Promote exercising outdoors.
* Help identify areas with higuer pollution so that the Council takes action.
* People can minimise breathing air of poor quality by checking real-time statistics on pollution.
* Local shops located in areas with less pollution might see an increase in their sales, as a result of more people doing outdoors exercise in those areas.
* Life expectancy might increase as a result of people chosing the air they breath. 
* Diseases associated to pollution might decrease overtime.
